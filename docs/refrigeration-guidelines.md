# Refrigeration Guidlelines For Desert Climates

Welcome to your desert retreat! Given the typically high temperatures in this region, our refrigeration units have to work extra hard. Here are some guidelines to ensure your refrigerator operates efficiently throughout your stay, keeping your food fresh without any hitches.

### Optimizing Your Refrigerator's Efficiency

- **Initial Cooling Period:** After stocking up, the refrigerator will need anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to recalibrate to the optimal temperature. This is normal, as it expends more energy to cool new items.
- **Minimize Door Openings:** Try to open the refrigerator door as infrequently as possible to prevent cold air loss. Each opening leads to a significant drop in interior temperature, forcing the unit to work harder.
- **Use of Coolers:** Consider using a cooler with ice for beverages. This approach reduces the number of times the refrigerator door is opened and helps maintain a consistent internal temperature.
- **Appropriate Temperature Settings:** Ensure that both the refrigerator and freezer are set at their recommended temperatures. Resist the urge to adjust to the coldest setting, as this might freeze the cooling system, rendering it ineffective for up to a day.
- **Smart Stocking:** Introduce new items gradually, especially in the case of bulk goods. This method gives the unit time to stabilize after each addition.
- **Immediate Assistance:** If you encounter any issues with the refrigerator, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations directly at (760) 465-4599. We're here to help!

### Important Don'ts

- **Avoid Over-adjusting the Temperature:** Do not turn the refrigerator or freezer to their coldest settings in an attempt to cool items quickly. This can cause the system to freeze and stop working, requiring up to 24 hours or more to defrost and reset.
- **Ensure Doors Are Fully Closed:** Leaving the refrigerator or freezer door ajar, even slightly, can significantly impact cooling efficiency and lead to system freezing due to overexertion.
- **Refrain from DIY Repairs:** Please don't attempt to fix any perceived issues yourself. For any malfunction or concerns, reach out to Palm Springs Luxury Vacations. Unauthorized repairs complicate system assessments and might inadvertently exacerbate issues.

Your understanding and cooperation in following these guidelines will help ensure that the refrigeration unit functions effectively, preventing unnecessary disruptions and additional costs.
