# Strict Noise Control Policy: Zero Tolerance

We emphasize your critical role in preserving the tranquil nature of our Palm Springs community. Non-negotiable rules are in place, and severe repercussions apply for any breach. This firm stance protects the serenity neighbors are entitled to and prevents dire consequences for property owners.

**Absolute Prohibitions and Severe Penalties:**

1. **No Outdoor Music - ZERO TOLERANCE:** Any form of outdoor music, regardless of volume or time of day, is strictly forbidden. The rule is absolute: NO OUTDOOR MUSIC. Violation of this rule is non-negotiable and is taken very seriously.
2. **Three-Strike Rule for Property Owners:** Homeowners face a stringent "three-strike" policy by the city. Any noise complaints against this property count as strikes. Accumulating three strikes has devastating implications for property owners, jeopardizing their valuable investment and legal ability to rent.
3. **Heavy Fines and Immediate Eviction:** Non-compliance with noise ordinances will result in immediate financial penalties. Fines from the city start at $250, and disturbances leading to a complaint call incur a minimum charge of $250 against your security deposit. Serious infractions, particularly loud noises or excess occupancy, trigger your immediate eviction without a refund.

**Mandatory Compliance Expectations:**

- **Indoor Noise Containment:** Post-9:00 PM, all conversations and activities must move indoors with windows and doors securely closed. Any noise capable of being heard beyond property boundaries constitutes a violation.
- **Responsibility for Fines:** Guests are wholly responsible for all fines resulting from disturbances. These fines result from non-adherence to city ordinances, and payment is non-negotiable.
- **Immediate Response Requirement:** Upon any complaint, guests must immediately correct their behavior. A 30-minute window is given for in-person intervention. Failure to comply or recurrence of disturbances will necessitate eviction as mandated by enforcement officials.

This strict enforcement is non-negotiable and exists to preserve the quality of life within our community. Your stay in Palm Springs demands a level of responsibility and respect for the sanctity of this residential haven. Non-compliance isn't tolerated and has swift, severe repercussions.

Respect these boundaries for a harmonious experience.

We sincerely wish that these restrictions weren't such a prevalent issue necessitating this stringent emphasis. However, it's crucial to understand that the severity and enforcement of these city ordinances are not to be underestimated. Compliance is not optional, and the consequences of violations are both immediate and severe. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in upholding the community standards that make Palm Springs a desirable destination for all.
