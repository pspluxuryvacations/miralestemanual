### Notice to All Guests: Community Respect and Noise Awareness

We wholeheartedly want you to enjoy your stay here. However, it's crucial to understand that this home is situated in a peaceful residential area with strict noise control regulations that the City of Palm Springs vigorously enforces.

**Here's what you need to know to avoid disruptions and penalties:**

1. **Respectful Behavior:** Whether you're staying overnight or just visiting for the day, please conduct yourself courteously. Keep noise levels modest and consider the tranquility of the neighbors. This house is not just a rental; it's part of a community.
2. **Strict Noise Ordinances:** The city enforces noise ordinances with severe consequences. Even minor violations, such as music playing outside, can result in hefty fines and a three 'strikes' rule against the property owner, severly threatening their investment.
3. **Penalties for Violations:** Disturbances causing complaints may lead to a minimum city fine of $250, plus a service call charge of $250 from Palm Springs Luxury Vacations against the security deposit. Severe offenses, like loud parties or over-occupancy, could lead to immediate eviction without refund.
4. **Community Member Approach:** Embrace the community spirit during your stay. Avoid loud music, disruptive gatherings, or any noisy activities that could disturb the peace. Neighbors cherish their serenity, and it's our shared responsibility to uphold it.

**Enjoying Palm Springs Responsibly:**

We're delighted you chose Palm Springs, a city celebrated for its warm hospitality and vibrant culture. While you explore the wonders here or unwind in leisure, remember you're a temporary member of our community. The residents around you appreciate the quiet and safe environment they've cultivated, and we count on you to contribute to this peaceful atmosphere.

Please, let's not disturb the tranquility that everyone values. Outside amplified music is prohibited, and non-compliance will attract police attention and possible citation. We understand you're here to enjoy yourself, but let's ensure your fun doesn't impinge on others' comfort.

**Remember:** A considerate guest makes for a harmonious neighborhood. Let's keep Palm Springs beautiful, enjoyable, and serene for everyone.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
