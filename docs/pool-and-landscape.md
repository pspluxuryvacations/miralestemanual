# Pool and Landscape Maintenance Schedule

**Pool Maintenance:**

- Regular service days: Tuesday and Friday.
- Due to weather conditions like wind, pools might need unscheduled cleanings. If any debris bothers you, do not hesitate to contact us.
- Meet Alfredo, our dedicated and friendly pool technician. If he arrives during your pool time, feel free to continue enjoying your swim. Alfredo will ensure the maintenance work is done discreetly without disrupting your relaxation.

**Landscaping Services:**

- Scheduled every Friday, subject to change based on seasonal demands.
- Our professional landscapers prioritize your comfort and privacy. If you're using the outdoor areas when they arrive, they'll conduct their work respectfully, allowing you to fully enjoy the property's amenities.

Your comfort is our priority, and we strive to keep our outdoor facilities in top shape without intruding on your personal space or relaxation time. Should you have any inquiries or specific needs, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations directly.
