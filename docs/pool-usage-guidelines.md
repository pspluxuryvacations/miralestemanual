# Pool Usage Guidelines

Welcome to one of the highlights of our property - the private pool area. To ensure your safety and enjoyment, please review the guidelines below carefully.

### Pool Hours and Lighting:

- The pool area is accessible to guests throughout their stay.
- For your convenience and safety, pool lights activate automatically at sundown and remain on until 1:00 AM.

### Safety Precautions:

- **No Lifeguard on Duty:** Swimming is at your own risk. There is no lifeguard on duty, and as such, guests are responsible for their own safety and supervision.
- **Child Supervision:** Please supervise children at ALL TIMES, particularly in and around the pool area.
- **Swim Sober:** Avoid the use of alcohol or substances when intending to swim. Impaired judgment and coordination increase the risk of accidents.
- **Furniture Care:** Do not sit on indoor furniture while wet from swimming, as pool chemicals can damage the upholstery. Costs for damage may be charged to guests.

### Pool Heating Instructions:

- The pool is equipped with a heating system. Should you require the pool to be heated, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations. We can adjust the temperature to your preference for a nominal fee. Unauthorized attempts to alter the heater or pumps may result in damage, for which guests might be held liable.

### Emergency Procedures:

- In case of an emergency, contact emergency services immediately.
- After ensuring safety, please inform Palm Springs Luxury Vacations of the situation.
