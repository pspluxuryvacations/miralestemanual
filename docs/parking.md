- **Garage Parking:** The property comes with a garage designed to accommodate one vehicle. The owner keeps their personal car in the adjacent spot. This secure space is ideal for ensuring your vehicle is protected from the elements.
- **Driveway Parking:** Beyond the garage, you can park an additional X number of cars directly on the driveway. It’s a convenient and safe space, perfect for when you have multiple vehicles in your party.
- **Street Parking:** While we understand it may sometimes be necessary, we kindly ask you to avoid extended street parking. If you must temporarily park on the street, please be considerate of our neighbors and the local community.
