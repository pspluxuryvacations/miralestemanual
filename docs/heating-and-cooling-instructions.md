Your comfort is important to us, which is why this property is equipped with an Ecobee thermostat. This smart device ensures your stay is as comfortable as possible. Below is a simple guide on how to use it:

### Adjusting the Temperature

2. **Select Your Desired Temperature:** Touch the screen and scroll the temperature setting up or down.
3. **Confirm Your Settings:** Once you've selected the temperature, the thermostat will automatically confirm your choice, and the HVAC system will adjust accordingly. The new setting will remain until the next scheduled change or until altered manually.

### Setting Specific Comfort Modes
