# Outdoor BBQ Grill Instructions

To complement your stay, we invite you to enjoy the use of our outdoor BBQ grill, perfect for dining al fresco in the beautiful surroundings. Below you will find step-by-step instructions to operate the grill safely and effectively.

### Lighting the Grill:

1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure the grill lid is open to prevent gas buildup.
   - Verify that all control knobs are in the 'OFF' position.
2. **Propane Gas:**
   - Open the valve on the propane tank fully for adequate gas flow.
3. **Ignition:**
   - Push and turn any of the control knobs to the 'LIGHT' position.
   - Press the 'IGNITE' button to initiate the flame.
   - Note: If the grill does not light within 5 seconds, turn the knobs to 'OFF', wait 5 minutes for any accumulated gas to dissipate, and then repeat the ignition procedure.

### After Grilling:

1. **Shutting Down:**
   - Once you've finished grilling, turn all control knobs to the 'OFF' position.
   - Close the valve on the propane tank to terminate the gas supply.
2. **Cleaning Up:**
   - While the grill is still warm, take the steel wire brush and clean the grill grates to remove any remaining residue. Immediate cleaning will prevent debris from hardening, making subsequent cleanups more manageable.

### Safety Note:

- Never leave the grill unattended while in use.
- Keep children and pets at a safe distance.
- For any issues or difficulties, contact the Palm Springs Luxury Vacations Team for assistance.
