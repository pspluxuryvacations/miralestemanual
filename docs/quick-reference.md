### Please Keep The Air Clean For Our Guests

#### This is a Non-Smoking Home

To preserve the quality of our indoor environment, we adhere to a strict non-smoking policy within the premises. This includes the use of cigarettes, cigars, e-cigarettes, and any other smoking devices. To accommodate guests who smoke, please do so outside away from open windows or doors. Smoking inside is not permitted under any circumstances.

#### You Will Be Responsible For The Cost of Smoking Remediation

In the event of any violations of this non-smoking policy, please be aware that you will be financially responsible for all costs associated with restoring the air quality and condition of the room or affected areas. This includes, but is not limited to, professional deep cleaning, deodorization, and repairs or replacements of damaged property. These remediation efforts are costly and necessary to uphold our standards of excellence for all guests.

#### Cigarette Smoke Remediation Is Not Covered By Damage Waiver

Please note that expenses related to smoke remediation are not covered under the standard damage waiver. They are considered avoidable damages rather than accidental harm or standard wear and tear of the property. As such, the costs associated with any needed remediation due to smoking will be separately charged and are not subject to any pre-existing damage protection agreement.

We sincerely thank you for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining the integrity and freshness of our beloved and pristine home. Our commitment is to ensure the next guest enjoys the same high-quality environment as you do.
