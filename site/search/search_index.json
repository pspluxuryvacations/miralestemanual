Earthquakes are a known and unpredictable natural phenomenon in California. While we wish you a tranquil stay, it's important to be prepared for such occurrences. Below are guidelines to ensure your and your family's safety during and after an earthquake. Protection Emergency Kit: We have provided an emergency kit with basic supplies (first aid, water, flashlights, etc.). Please familiarize yourself with its contents and location. Emergency Plan: Discuss an emergency plan with everyone in your group, including a safe spot to meet outside the building should an earthquake occur. During the Earthquake Drop, Cover, and Hold On: In the event of an earthquake, protect yourself right away. Drop to your hands and knees, cover your head and neck with your arms, and if possible, take cover under sturdy furniture. Hold on until the shaking stops. Stay Indoors: Avoid running outside due to the risk of falling debris. Stay inside until the shaking ceases. Stay Away from Windows and Exterior Walls: Glass can shatter, and walls could collapse during an earthquake. Try to stay within the interior areas of the home. After the Earthquake Check for Injuries: Once the shaking stops, check for injuries among your group. Use the first aid kit if necessary and if safe, evacuate the building. Inspect Surroundings: Be cautious of hazards such as broken glass, damaged electrical wiring, or gas leaks. If you suspect a gas leak, immediately vacate the property and notify us. Stay Updated: Use a battery-powered radio, your mobile phone, or other devices to stay updated on the situation. Be prepared for aftershocks. Contact Us: Once you\u2019re in a safe location, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations at (760) 465-4599 for further instructions and support.

It\u2019s a convenient and safe space, perfect for when you have multiple vehicles in your party. Street Parking: While we understand it may sometimes be necessary, we kindly ask you to avoid extended street parking. If you must temporarily park on the street, please be considerate of our neighbors and the local community. Sidewalks: Accessibility for pedestrians on the sidewalks is a top priority.

This smart device ensures your stay is as comfortable as possible. Below is a simple guide on how to use it: Adjusting the Temperature Wake the Thermostat: Approach the Ecobee thermostat to activate its screen. You'll see the current temperature display and several icons, indicating various features. Select Your Desired Temperature: Touch the screen and scroll the temperature setting up or down. Confirm Your Settings: Once you've selected the temperature, the thermostat will automatically confirm your choice, and the HVAC system will adjust accordingly. The new setting will remain until the next scheduled change or until altered manually. Setting Specific Comfort Modes Home, Away, and Sleep: Ecobee provides pre-set comfort settings based on common scenarios. For instance, 'Away' optimizes energy savings when you're out. To select a mode, tap the three-bar icon on the bottom left, choose 'Comfort Settings,' and select your desired mode. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the thermostat's functions, don't hesitate to contact us for assistance. We want to ensure your environment is set to your preference throughout your stay. Refrigeration Guidlelines For Desert Climates Welcome to your desert retreat! Given the typically high temperatures in this region, our refrigeration units have to work extra hard. Here are some guidelines to ensure your refrigerator operates efficiently throughout your stay, keeping your food fresh without any hitches. Optimizing Your Refrigerator's Efficiency Initial Cooling Period: After stocking up, the refrigerator will need anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to recalibrate to the optimal temperature. This is normal, as it expends more energy to cool new items. Minimize Door Openings: Try to open the refrigerator door as infrequently as possible to prevent cold air loss. Each opening leads to a significant drop in interior temperature, forcing the unit to work harder. Use of Coolers: Consider using a cooler with ice for beverages. This approach reduces the number of times the refrigerator door is opened and helps maintain a consistent internal temperature. Appropriate Temperature Settings: Ensure that both the refrigerator and freezer are set at their recommended temperatures. Resist the urge to adjust to the coldest setting, as this might freeze the cooling system, rendering it ineffective for up to a day. Smart Stocking: Introduce new items gradually, especially in the case of bulk goods. This method gives the unit time to stabilize after each addition. Immediate Assistance: If you encounter any issues with the refrigerator, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations directly at (760) 465-4599. We're here to help! Important Don'ts Avoid Over-adjusting the Temperature: Do not turn the refrigerator or freezer to their coldest settings in an attempt to cool items quickly. This can cause the system to freeze and stop working, requiring up to 24 hours or more to defrost and reset. Ensure Doors Are Fully Closed: Leaving the refrigerator or freezer door ajar, even slightly, can significantly impact cooling efficiency and lead to system freezing due to overexertion. Refrain from DIY Repairs: Please don't attempt to fix any perceived issues yourself. For any malfunction or concerns, reach out to Palm Springs Luxury Vacations. Unauthorized repairs complicate system assessments and might inadvertently exacerbate issues. Your understanding and cooperation in following these guidelines will help ensure that the refrigeration unit functions effectively, preventing unnecessary disruptions and additional costs. Remember, in the event of any trouble, we are just a call away and are committed to ensuring your stay is comfortable and hassle-free.

House Notices What Your Cleaning Fee Includes Notice to All Guests: Community Respect and Noise Awareness Notice to All Guests: Community Respect and Noise Awareness We wholeheartedly want you to enjoy your stay here. However, it's crucial to understand that this home is situated in a peaceful residential area with strict noise control regulations that the City of Palm Springs vigorously enforces. Here's what you need to know to avoid disruptions and penalties: Respectful Behavior: Whether you're staying overnight or just visiting for the day, please conduct yourself courteously. Keep noise levels modest and consider the tranquility of the neighbors. This house is not just a rental; it's part of a community. Strict Noise Ordinances: The city enforces noise ordinances with severe consequences. Even minor violations, such as music playing outside, can result in hefty fines and a three 'strikes' rule against the property owner, severly threatening their investment. Penalties for Violations: Disturbances causing complaints may lead to a minimum city fine of $250, plus a service call charge of $250 from Palm Springs Luxury Vacations against the security deposit. Severe offenses, like loud parties or over-occupancy, could lead to immediate eviction without refund. Community Member Approach: Embrace the community spirit during your stay. Avoid loud music, disruptive gatherings, or any noisy activities that could disturb the peace. Neighbors cherish their serenity, and it's our shared responsibility to uphold it. Enjoying Palm Springs Responsibly: We're delighted you chose Palm Springs, a city celebrated for its warm hospitality and vibrant culture. While you explore the wonders here or unwind in leisure, remember you're a temporary member of our community. The residents around you appreciate the quiet and safe environment they've cultivated, and we count on you to contribute to this peaceful atmosphere. Please, let's not disturb the tranquility that everyone values. Outside amplified music is prohibited, and non-compliance will attract police attention and possible citation. We understand you're here to enjoy yourself, but let's ensure your fun doesn't impinge on others' comfort. Remember: A considerate guest makes for a harmonious neighborhood. Let's keep Palm Springs beautiful, enjoyable, and serene for everyone. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Strict Noise Control Policy: Zero Tolerance We emphasize your critical role in preserving the tranquil nature of our Palm Springs community. Non-negotiable rules are in place, and severe repercussions apply for any breach. This firm stance protects the serenity neighbors are entitled to and prevents dire consequences for property owners. Absolute Prohibitions and Severe Penalties: No Outdoor Music - ZERO TOLERANCE: Any form of outdoor music, regardless of volume or time of day, is strictly forbidden. The rule is absolute: NO OUTDOOR MUSIC. Violation of this rule is non-negotiable and is taken very seriously. Three-Strike Rule for Property Owners: Homeowners face a stringent \"three-strike\" policy by the city. Any noise complaints against this property count as strikes. Accumulating three strikes has devastating implications for property owners, jeopardizing their valuable investment and legal ability to rent. Heavy Fines and Immediate Eviction: Non-compliance with noise ordinances will result in immediate financial penalties. Fines from the city start at $250, and disturbances leading to a complaint call incur a minimum charge of $250 against your security deposit. Serious infractions, particularly loud noises or excess occupancy, trigger your immediate eviction without a refund. Mandatory Compliance Expectations: Indoor Noise Containment: Post-9:00 PM, all conversations and activities must move indoors with windows and doors securely closed. Any noise capable of being heard beyond property boundaries constitutes a violation. Responsibility for Fines: Guests are wholly responsible for all fines resulting from disturbances. These fines result from non-adherence to city ordinances, and payment is non-negotiable. Immediate Response Requirement: Upon any complaint, guests must immediately correct their behavior. A 30-minute window is given for in-person intervention. Failure to comply or recurrence of disturbances will necessitate eviction as mandated by enforcement officials. This strict enforcement is non-negotiable and exists to preserve the quality of life within our community. Your stay in Palm Springs demands a level of responsibility and respect for the sanctity of this residential haven. Non-compliance isn't tolerated and has swift, severe repercussions. Respect these boundaries for a harmonious experience. We sincerely wish that these restrictions weren't such a prevalent issue necessitating this stringent emphasis. However, it's crucial to understand that the severity and enforcement of these city ordinances are not to be underestimated. Compliance is not optional, and the consequences of violations are both immediate and severe. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in upholding the community standards that make Palm Springs a desirable destination for all.

This is normal, as it expends more energy to cool new items. Minimize Door Openings: Try to open the refrigerator door as infrequently as possible to prevent cold air loss. Each opening leads to a significant drop in interior temperature, forcing the unit to work harder. Use of Coolers: Consider using a cooler with ice for beverages. This approach reduces the number of times the refrigerator door is opened and helps maintain a consistent internal temperature. Appropriate Temperature Settings: Ensure that both the refrigerator and freezer are set at their recommended temperatures. Resist the urge to adjust to the coldest setting, as this might freeze the cooling system, rendering it ineffective for up to a day. Smart Stocking: Introduce new items gradually, especially in the case of bulk goods. This method gives the unit time to stabilize after each addition. Immediate Assistance: If you encounter any issues with the refrigerator, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations directly at (760) 465-4599. We're here to help!","title":"Optimizing Your Refrigerator's Efficiency"},{"location":"#important-donts","text":"Avoid Over-adjusting the Temperature: Do not turn the refrigerator or freezer to their coldest settings in an attempt to cool items quickly. This can cause the system to freeze and stop working, requiring up to 24 hours or more to defrost and reset. Ensure Doors Are Fully Closed: Leaving the refrigerator or freezer door ajar, even slightly, can significantly impact cooling efficiency and lead to system freezing due to overexertion. Refrain from DIY Repairs: Please don't attempt to fix any perceived issues yourself. For any malfunction or concerns, reach out to Palm Springs Luxury Vacations. Unauthorized repairs complicate system assessments and might inadvertently exacerbate issues.

Given the typically high temperatures in this region, our refrigeration units have to work extra hard. Here are some guidelines to ensure your refrigerator operates efficiently throughout your stay, keeping your food fresh without any hitches. Optimizing Your Refrigerator's Efficiency Initial Cooling Period: After stocking up, the refrigerator will need anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours to recalibrate to the optimal temperature. This is normal, as it expends more energy to cool new items. Minimize Door Openings: Try to open the refrigerator door as infrequently as possible to prevent cold air loss. Each opening leads to a significant drop in interior temperature, forcing the unit to work harder. Use of Coolers: Consider using a cooler with ice for beverages. This approach reduces the number of times the refrigerator door is opened and helps maintain a consistent internal temperature. Appropriate Temperature Settings: Ensure that both the refrigerator and freezer are set at their recommended temperatures. Resist the urge to adjust to the coldest setting, as this might freeze the cooling system, rendering it ineffective for up to a day. Smart Stocking: Introduce new items gradually, especially in the case of bulk goods. This method gives the unit time to stabilize after each addition. Immediate Assistance: If you encounter any issues with the refrigerator, please contact Palm Springs Luxury Vacations directly at (760) 465-4599. We're here to help! Important Don'ts Avoid Over-adjusting the Temperature: Do not turn the refrigerator or freezer to their coldest settings in an attempt to cool items quickly. This can cause the system to freeze and stop working, requiring up to 24 hours or more to defrost and reset. Ensure Doors Are Fully Closed: Leaving the refrigerator or freezer door ajar, even slightly, can significantly impact cooling efficiency and lead to system freezing due to overexertion. Refrain from DIY Repairs: Please don't attempt to fix any perceived issues yourself. For any malfunction or concerns, reach out to Palm Springs Luxury Vacations. Unauthorized repairs complicate system assessments and might inadvertently exacerbate issues. Your understanding and cooperation in following these guidelines will help ensure that the refrigeration unit functions effectively, preventing unnecessary disruptions and additional costs. Remember, in the event of any trouble, we are just a call away and are committed to ensuring your stay is comfortable and hassle-free.","title":"Refrigeration Guidlelines For Desert Climates"},{"location":"refrigeration-guidelines/#refrigeration-guidlelines-for-desert-climates","text":"Welcome to your desert retreat!
